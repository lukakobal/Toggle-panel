## Toggle Panel – React Basics 🔁

Simple example of state-driven UI in React.

### Concepts used
- `useState`
- state → re-render
- conditional rendering with `&&`

### Key idea
UI does not change by clicks.  
UI changes because **state changes**.

This pattern is used for:
- dropdowns
- accordions
- sidebars
- modals
